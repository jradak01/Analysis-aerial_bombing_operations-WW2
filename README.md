# Analysis of aerial bombing operations in World War II

## Project Description

### Introduction
World War II is one of the most terrifying events in recent history. Occurring just 21 years after some of the other most horrifying wars in history (WW1), it involved nearly all countries of the world. It began with Germany's invasion of Poland (September 1, 1939) and ended (September 2, 1945) with the victory of the Allies (USA, USSR, UK, etc.). As this war unfolded in more recent history, we have a considerable amount of documents and information from this period. It is also the most documented war in human history.

World War II involved continuous strategic bombing of cities, ports, railways, and the like. Strategic bombing was designed to destroy a country's ability to wage war by demoralizing civilians and targeting elements of enemy infrastructure. Bombing certainly had a significant impact on the end and outcome of the war (atomic bombs, etc.), making such data highly interesting.

### Summary
In this project, we will familiarize ourselves with the data, its structure, and meaning. We will assess the cleanliness of the dataset, checking for missing values, duplicates, the nature of values present in this dataset, etc. Additionally, we will perform some data processing such as attempting to reconstruct missing values and splitting values from one column into multiple columns. After that, by posing questions, visualization, and answering those questions, we will delve further into the data and uncover some interesting facts. Subsequently, we will statistically analyze the selected dataset by formulating hypotheses, observing measures of dispersion, correlations, etc. Using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, we will attempt to place certain coordinates into specific operational areas. Finally, assuming the war lasted for another year, we will forecast how many more bombs would have fallen in that period.
